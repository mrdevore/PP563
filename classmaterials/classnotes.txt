git pull = pull changes from my GitHub repository to my local one
git pull upstream master = pull any changes from original owner's repository into my forked repository

If there are different versions of a file between my local and GitHub repositories, I will need to
manually open the file and change it in my text editor by deleting the parts I don't want, then pushing
it to GitHub
