git pull = pull changes from my GitHub repository to my local one
git pull upstream master = pull any changes from original owner's repository into my forked repository

If there are different versions of a file between my local and GitHub repositories, I will need to
manually open the file and change it in my text editor by deleting the parts I don't want, then pushing
it to GitHub

## What is multiple sequence alignment (MSA)?
    - alignment introduces gaps to align sequences that are similar but not identical (we don't know the
    exact position in ancestors)
        - assumption: each line/column shares a common ancestor --> maybe there was a deletion or insertion
        since the common ancestor, that would leave a gap
        - we align sequences without knowing the processes that got us there, MSA helps us get there
            - purely computational, MSA aligns without knowledge of biological processes
                - super computationally intensive!!
            - would be ideal if computer could spit out the right answer each time, but often the computer
            cannot pick the best one --> biologists must have input/opinion and make decisions at every step
    - ACAT > AGAT example:
        - would think it was a substitution
        - we have to include/decide on the cost of substitutions and the cost of indels --> will direct
        computer's decisions between trees
            - cost = probability of it happening
                - often we don't know, but we have to choose anyway
    - ACATTA > TACA based on known events (see class page)
        solution: -ACATTA
                  T--AC-A
        intutive version: -ACATTA
                          TACA---
    - alignment represents a series of events, going forward we will assume we do not have the correct alignment
        - we guide the algorithm by picking penalties for events (indels, subs)
